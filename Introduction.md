## Introduction

Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling in the early '90s. The project initially began under the name "Oak", with the aim in mind "Write Once, Run Anywhere". Since then, It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of todayâ€™s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built. With all the perks, development in Java requires JRE (Java Runtime Environment) which in now included in JDK (Java Development Kit)

## Why Java?

Java remains to be one of the most widely used in the programming language industry due to the a lot of factors, few of them are the following.

* **Java is platform independent** - In this versatile industry, it's very crucial for a programming language to have the ability to work on different systems and environment. *Once compiled (converted into the byte-code) a `.class` file is created that can be executed on any system*. This is one of the most significant reason why Java still remains to be the dominant language in the industry.

* **Java is object-oriented** - The Object oriented programming methodology of Java allows you to create modular, reuseable codes and provide effective problem solving.

* **Java is built upon a virtual machine** - Making your application Robust, secure and highly portable in nature.

* **Multi-threading** : Thread is a light-weight subprocess. Multi-threading in Java allows concurrent execution of two or more threads simultaneously. It maximizes the utilization of the CPU.

## Where is Java used?

* **Mobile Applications** : Java is majorly used for Mobile Development, especially Android Development. Serving as both Front-end and Back-end ranging from mobile applications to game development, Java remains to be the dominant and the most preferred language for Mobile development.

* **Big Data Technologies** : Java is widely used in ETL applications such as Apache Camel and Apache Kafka. It is used to extract and transform data, and load in big data environments.

* **Desktop GUI Application** : Along with the Back-End of an application, Java also has tools such as JavaFX, Swing, AWT for front-end.

* **Game Development** : Java is widely used by game development companies because it has the support of the open-source most powerful 3D engine. There are some popular Frameworks and Libraries available for Game Development, like - LibGDX and OpenGL. Fun-fact! Minecraft is developed in Java.

* **Cloud-Based Applications** : Java provides you with features that can help you build applications meaning that it can be used in the SaaS, IaaS and PaaS development. Java applications are often referred to as WORA (write once, run anywhere), which means the language is perfect for decentralized, cloud-based applications.

* **Artificial Intelligence** : Java is very adept when it comes to machine learning libraries like Deep Learning for Java (DL4J) and Apache Spark's MLib, which can also be used with Python and R Language. Fun-fact! Netflix (for predicting what you'll watch next).

* **Scientific Applications of Java** : MATLAB (Mathematical Laboratory) which is one of the most popular scientific applications, uses Java for developing both front-end (interactive user-interface) and back-end (a core part of the system).

## What will you learn?

In this module, We'll learn to:

* Write a program in Java by using basic syntax.
* Recognize Java terminology, including data types, libraries, and functions.
* Identify and correct common programming errors.

*In the Next Unit, We will start with creating a Java file, compiling the java the file and executing the Java file.*
